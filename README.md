# Code-for-Ensembl-to-Gene-name,see description for more details
This R code allows you to quickly convert gene names into Ensembl IDs with just one click. I've included the TARGETGENES.csv file for your convenience. You can copy and paste your targeted gene list from column A2. Feel free to rename the file, but make sure to update the input file name accordingly.
When you run the code, it will provide the corresponding Ensembl IDs for the specified genes. This code is designed for the human dataset, using the "hsapiens_gene_ensembl" reference. You can adjust it as needed for different datasets.
This brief introduction is intended for entry-level bioinformaticians or molecular biologists. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
